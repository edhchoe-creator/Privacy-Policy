Privacy Policy for Countdown AR  
Effective Date: 11/24/2025  

Countdown AR ("the App") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains that no personal data is collected or stored by the App.  

Data Collection  
Countdown AR does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data. The App does not require accounts, registration, or any form of identification. The only information received is if you voluntarily contact support via email.  

Use of Data  
Since no personal or usage data is collected, none is used for any purpose. Any support correspondence is handled solely to provide assistance.  

Notifications  
The App may request permission to send notifications (e.g., countdown reminders), but this is managed entirely by your device settings. No notification data is collected or shared.  

Third-Party Services  
Countdown AR does not integrate any third-party trackers, advertising networks, or analytics services.  

Face Data and TrueDepth API Usage

Our app uses Apple’s TrueDepth API to enable certain augmented reality (AR) features. When AR mode is active, the app may access facial tracking information such as face anchor position, orientation, eye direction, and blend shape coefficients.

We do not collect, store, transfer, or share any TrueDepth or face data.
All TrueDepth information is processed strictly in real-time on the device to align AR content with the user’s movements. No raw depth maps, face geometry, or biometric identifiers are ever saved or transmitted. The data is discarded immediately after each frame and is never used for identification, authentication, advertising, analytics, or any other secondary purpose.

Data Sharing  
No data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties. Information is only disclosed if required by law.  

Your Rights  
You may:  
- Contact us to delete any information you have voluntarily provided.  
- Disable notifications anytime via your device settings.  

Data Security  
We implement reasonable technical measures to protect any user contact information. However, no system can guarantee absolute security.  

Changes to Policy  
Updates will be posted here with an updated effective date.
