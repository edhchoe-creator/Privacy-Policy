PRIVACY POLICY – COUNTDOWN AR

Effective Date: January 2026

Countdown AR ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights as a user of the App.

Information We Collect

Personal Information
Countdown AR does not require you to create an account or provide personal information. We do not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists. The only time we receive personal information is if you voluntarily contact us by email.

Usage and Technical Data
Countdown AR does not directly collect or store personally identifiable usage data. However, limited technical data may be processed by Apple or third-party services used by the App (such as advertising or in-app purchases) in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

Virtual Items and Coins

Countdown AR includes optional virtual items such as coins, collectible app icons, and visual effects. These items are used solely within the App to unlock features and customize the experience.

Coins and virtual items do not require personal information to use. Any purchase or entitlement information is handled by Apple’s App Store and is not linked to user identity beyond what Apple provides to the App.

Face Data and TrueDepth API Usage

The App uses Apple’s TrueDepth API to enable certain augmented reality (AR) features. When AR mode is active, the App may access facial tracking information such as face anchor position, orientation, eye direction, and blend shape coefficients.

Countdown AR does not collect, store, transfer, or share any TrueDepth or face data. All facial tracking information is processed strictly in real time on the device to align AR content with the user’s movements.

No raw depth maps, face geometry, biometric identifiers, or facial data are saved, stored, transmitted, or used for identification, authentication, analytics, advertising, or any secondary purpose. All data is immediately discarded after each frame.

Third-Party Services

The App uses limited third-party services that are necessary to provide core functionality such as advertising and in-app purchases. These services may process limited, non-personal technical data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

Third-party services used by Countdown AR may include:

Google AdMob (advertising)

Apple App Store / StoreKit (subscriptions and purchases)

Notification Permissions

Countdown AR may request permission to send notifications, such as countdown reminders or milestone alerts. Notification permissions are optional and managed entirely through iOS system settings. The App does not collect or store notification content.

Sharing Your Information

Countdown AR does not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties. Information may only be disclosed if required by law or legal process.

Your Rights

You may:

Request deletion of any information you have voluntarily sent via email

Disable notifications at any time through your device settings

Data Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no system can guarantee absolute security.

Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted with a revised effective date. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
