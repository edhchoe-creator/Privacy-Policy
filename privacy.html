<h1>Privacy Policy for Countdown AR</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
Countdown AR ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights
as a user of the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
Countdown AR does not require you to create an account or provide personal information.
We do not collect names, addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists.
The only time we receive personal information is if you voluntarily contact us by email.
</p>

<p><strong>Usage and Technical Data</strong><br>
Countdown AR does not directly collect or store personally identifiable usage data.
However, limited technical data may be processed by Apple or third-party services
used by the App (such as advertising or in-app purchases) in accordance with their
respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>2. Virtual Items and Coins</h2>
<p>
Countdown AR includes optional virtual items such as coins, collectible app icons,
and visual effects. These items are used solely within the App to unlock features
and customize the experience.
</p>

<p>
Coins and virtual items do not require personal information to use.
Any purchase or entitlement information is handled by Apple’s App Store and is not
linked to user identity beyond what Apple provides to the App.
</p>

<h2>3. Face Data and TrueDepth API Usage</h2>
<p>
The App uses Apple’s TrueDepth API to enable certain augmented reality (AR) features.
When AR mode is active, the App may access facial tracking information such as face anchor
position, orientation, eye direction, and blend shape coefficients.
</p>

<p>
Countdown AR does not collect, store, transfer, or share any TrueDepth or face data.
All facial tracking information is processed strictly in real time on the device
to align AR content with the user’s movements.
</p>

<p>
No raw depth maps, face geometry, biometric identifiers, or facial data are saved,
stored, transmitted, or used for identification, authentication, analytics,
advertising, or any secondary purpose.
All data is immediately discarded after each frame.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App uses limited third-party services that are necessary to provide core
functionality such as advertising and in-app purchases.
These services may process limited, non-personal technical data in accordance
with their own privacy policies.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Google AdMob (advertising)</li>
    <li>Apple App Store / StoreKit (subscriptions and purchases)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Notification Permissions</h2>
<p>
Countdown AR may request permission to send notifications, such as countdown reminders
or milestone alerts.
Notification permissions are optional and managed entirely through iOS system settings.
The App does not collect or store notification content.
</p>

<h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>
Countdown AR does not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties.
Information may only be disclosed if required by law or legal process.
</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request deletion of any information you have voluntarily sent via email.</li>
    <li>Disable notifications at any time in your device settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>
<p>
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information.
However, no system can guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
